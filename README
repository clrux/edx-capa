## Quick start

We use Jekyll to view this work locally. To get started:

* clone this repo
* run `npm install` to grab any packages and dependencies
* ensure Jekyll is installed
  * `gem install jekyll`
* launch the CAPA preview site with `jekyll serve`

The site is viewable at http://localhost:4000
